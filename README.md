## Objectives

- Extract sales data from Amazon (or a simulated dataset) using SQL.
- Transform the data to derive month-wise, year-wise, and yearly-month-wise sales trends.
- Load the processed data into Power BI for visualization and analysis.
- Identify key performance metrics (KPIs) to establish meaningful relationships in sales performance.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Data Extraction**: SQL for querying and extracting data from databases.
- **Data Transformation**: Excel for data manipulation and calculations.
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI for creating interactive dashboards and reports.

### Key Metrics to Analyze
